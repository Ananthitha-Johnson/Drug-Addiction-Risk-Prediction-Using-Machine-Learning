# Drug Addiction Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts the risk of drug addiction using behavioral and social factors.
A synthetic dataset was generated to ensure ethical compliance and data privacy.

## Features Used
- Age
- Stress Level
- Peer Pressure
- Family History
- Mental Health Score
- Academic Pressure

## Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

## Results
Both models achieved reliable accuracy in identifying high-risk individuals.

## Ethical Considerations
- No real personal data was used.
- Dataset is fully synthetic.
- Model is intended for educational and awareness purposes only.
- Predictions should not be used for medical diagnosis.

## Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Future Improvements
- Include more behavioral factors
- Use ensemble models
- Deploy as a web application
