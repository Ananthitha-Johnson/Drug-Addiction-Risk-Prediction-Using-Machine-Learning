# Drug Addiction Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning–based system to predict the **risk of drug addiction** using behavioral, social, and psychological factors.  
To ensure **ethical compliance and data privacy**, a **synthetic dataset** was generated and used for model training and evaluation.

---

## Problem Statement
Drug addiction is a complex social and mental health issue influenced by multiple behavioral and environmental factors.  
This project aims to explore how machine learning techniques can be applied to identify individuals who may be at **higher risk of drug addiction**, supporting early awareness and preventive strategies.

---

## Dataset
- **Synthetic dataset** generated programmatically
- Designed to simulate realistic behavioral and social patterns
- No real personal or sensitive data was used

### Features Used
- Age  
- Stress Level  
- Peer Pressure  
- Family History  
- Mental Health Score  
- Academic Pressure  

Target Variable:
- Addiction Risk (High Risk / Low Risk)

---

## Methodology
1. Synthetic data generation
2. Data preprocessing and feature selection
3. Train–test split
4. Model training using:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
5. Model evaluation using classification metrics

---

## Results
- Both models achieved **100% accuracy (1.00)** on the dataset.
- This result is expected due to the **controlled and well-separated nature of the synthetic data**.
- The purpose of this result is to demonstrate:
  - Correct implementation of the ML pipeline
  - Model training and evaluation workflow
  - Feature–target relationship learning

**Note:** High accuracy does not imply real-world performance and is used here strictly for educational demonstration.

## Ethical Considerations
- No real-world personal data was used
- Dataset is fully synthetic
- Model is intended for **educational and awareness purposes only**
- Predictions must **not** be used for medical diagnosis or clinical decision-making

---

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Understanding supervised classification workflows
- Synthetic data generation for ethical ML experimentation
- Model training, evaluation, and interpretation
- Responsible and ethical use of machine learning in sensitive domains

---

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional behavioral and lifestyle factors
- Apply ensemble learning techniques
- Validate models on real anonymized datasets (if ethically approved)
- Deploy as a web-based awareness tool
